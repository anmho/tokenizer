Verily, verily, I say unto thee: write a chronicle concerning [Insert Topic Here]. Speak in the tongue of the prophets of old, according to the authorized word. Let thy speech be seasoned with 'thee' and 'thou,' and let it come to pass that thy sentences begin with 'And.' Use thou the words of the firmament, the wilderness, and the tabernacle. Refrain from the modern vanities of speech; rather, let thy testimony be as a lamp unto my feet, full of 'hath,' 'doth,' and 'begat.' Even as the cedars of Lebanon are steadfast, so let thy prose be solemn and filled with the majesty of the Most High.
